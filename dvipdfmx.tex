\chapter{Getting Started}

\section{Introduction}

The \dvipdfmx\ (formerly \dvipdfm-cjk) project provides an extended version of
the \dvipdfm, a DVI to PDF translator developed by Mark~A.~Wicks.

The primary goal of this project is to support multi-byte character encodings
and large character sets such as for East Asian languages.
This project started as a combined work of the \dvipdfm-jpn project by
Shunsaku Hirata and its modified one, \dvipdfm-kor, by Jin-Hwan Cho.

Extensions to \dvipdfm\ include,
\begin{itemize}
    \item Support for OpenType and TrueType font, including partial support
    for OpenType Layout for finding glyphs and vertical writing.
    \item Support for CJK-\LaTeX\ and H\LaTeX\ with Subfont Definition Files.
    \item Support for various legacy multi-byte encodings via PostScript CMap
     Resources.
    \item Unicode related features: Unicode as an input encoding and
    auto-creation of ToUnicode CMaps.
    \item Support for p\TeX\ (a Japanese localized variant of \TeX) including
    vertical writing extension.
    \item Some extended DVI specials.
    \item Reduction of output files size with on-the-fly Type1 to CFF (Type1C)
    conversion and PDF object stream.
    \item Advanced raster image support including alpha channels, embedded
    ICC profiles, 16-bit bit-depth colors, and so on.
    \item Basic PDF password security support for PDF output.
\end{itemize}
Some important features are still missing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Linearization.
    \item Color Management.
    \item Resampling of images.
    \item Selection of compression filters.
    \item Variable font and OpenType 1.8.
    \item and many more...
\end{itemize}

\dvipdfmx\ is now maintained as part of \TeX\ Live. Latest source code can
be found at \TeX\ Live SVN repository. For an instruction on accessing the
development sources for \TeX\ Live, see,\medskip

\url{http://www.tug.org/texlive/svn/}
\medskip

This document, ``The \dvipdfmx\ User's Manual'', was originally prepared for
\TeX\ Live 2017. Current maintainer of this document is Shunsaku Hirata.
Latest version and contact information can be found at:\medskip

\url{http://github.com/shirat74/dvipdfm-x-doc}
\medskip

\noindent{}Please send quenstions or suggestions.

\subsection{\xdvipdfmx}

\xdvipdfmx\ is an extended version of \dvipdfmx, and is now incorporated into
\dvipdfmx.

The \xdvipdfmx\ extensions provides support for the Extended DVI (.xdv) format
generated by \XeTeX which includes support for platform-native fonts and the
\XeTeX\ graphics primitives, as well as Unicode text and OpenType font.

\XeTeX\ originally used a Mac-specific program called \code{xdv2pdf} as a
backend program instead of \xdvipdfmx. The \code{xdv2pdf} program supported
a couple of special effects that are not yet available through \xdvipdfmx:
The Quartz graphics-based shadow support, AAT ``variation'' fonts such as Skia,
transparency as an attribute of font, and so on.
It would be nice if they continue to be supported. Suggestions and help are
welcomed.

\section{Installation and Usage}

Typical usage and installation steps are not different from the original
\dvipdfm. Please refer documents from \dvipdfm\ distribution for detailed
instruction on how to install and how to use \dvipdfm. The \dvipdfm\ manual is
available from its CTAN site:\medskip

\url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/dviware/dvipdfm}
\medskip

The minimal requirements for building \dvipdfmx\ is the \code{kpathsea} library.
\code{zlib} for compression and \code{libpng} for PNG inclusion are highly
recommended. Optionally, the libpaper library may be used to handle paper sizes.

This document only describes additions and modifications to \dvipdfm.
Please refer the
``\href{http://mirrors.ctan.org/dviware/dvipdfm/dvipdfm.pdf}{Dvipdfm User's Manual}''
available from the CTAN site mentioned above for basic usage.

Some additional command line options recognized by \dvipdfmx\ are listed in
Table~\ref{TABLE:options}. Try
\begin{lstlisting}
dvipdfmx --help
\end{lstlisting}
for the list of command line options and thier explanations.

\section{Quick Guide}

\dvipdfmx\ is supposed to be used by users of \LaTeX\ packages for typesetting
CJK languages like H\LaTeX\ and CJK-\LaTeX, and \TeX\ variants such as \XeTeX,
p\TeX, and up\TeX.
This section is intended to be a quick guide for each users.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\XeTeX}{XeTeX}}
For \XeTeX\ users, most part of this document is irrelevant except section of
``\hyperref[SEC:graphics]{Graphics and Image Formats}'' and
``\hyperref[SEC:specials]{DVI Specials}''.

\subsection{p\TeX}
p\TeX\ users are at least required to install several auxilially files
mentioned in the section of ``\hyperref[SEC:auxfiles]{Auxilially Files}''
and to setup fontmappings. Just install the \package{adobemappings} and
\package{glyphlist} for auxilially files. (As \TeX\ Live basic intallation
requires them, they are probably already installed for \TeX\ Live users.)

Setting up fontmaps can be done easily with help of the \package{ptex-fontmaps}
package. For examples, to use with IPA fonts (contained
in the \package{ipaex} package), run,
\begin{lstlisting}
updmap ipaex
\end{lstlisting}
Alternatively, just for a quick test of installation, try the following:
\begin{lstlisting}
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\special{pdf:mapline rml H KozMinProVI-Regular}
...Some Japanese text goes here...
\end{document}
\end{lstlisting}
In this example, PDF viewer which can handle substitute font is required since
\dvipdfmx\ does not embed fonts.

For using Japanese text in PDF document information and annotations, put
the following \code{special} command,
\begin{lstlisting}
\AtBeginDocument{\special{pdf:tounicode 90ms-RKSJ-UCS2}}
\end{lstlisting}
in the preamble.
The above \code{special} command instructs \dvipdfmx\ to convert text encoded
in Shift-JIS to Unicode. For EUC-JP, replace 90ms-RKJK-UCS2 with EUC-UCS2.

\subsection{up\TeX}
up\TeX\ users are basically the same as p\TeX\ users but there are two choices
for setting fontmaps. Setup fontmaps as mentioned in the above for p\TeX, or use
keyword \code{unicode} in the encoding field of fontmap files.

The former case might be easier as auto-creation of fontmap files can be done
with the \code{updmap} program and the \package{ptex-fontmaps} package. But in
this method there are some difficulties when using fonts which employ character
collection (glyph repertoire) other than Adobe-Japan1 in the case of PostScript
flvavored OpenType fonts.
In the later case, the \package{adobemappings} package is not reuiqred
and newer PostScript flavored OpenType fonts which do not employ Adobe-Japan1
can be used too.

Using \code{unicode} is more simpler and intuitive thus it is recommended to
use this method.\footnote{For \TeX\ Live 2017. Earlier versions have buggy
support.}
Typical example fontmap entries for using Adobe's SouceHan fonts look like:
\begin{lstlisting}
urml    unicode  SourceHanSerifJP-Light.otf
urmlv   unicode  SourceHanSerifJP-Light.otf  -w 1
ugbm    unicode  SourceHanSansJP-Medium.otf
ugbmv   unicode  SourceHanSansJP-Medium.otf  -w 1
\end{lstlisting}

As in p\TeX, the following \code{special} instruction is necessary to PDF
document information and annotations to  be shown correctly:
\begin{lstlisting}
\AtBeginDocument{\special{pdf:tounicode UTF8-UCS2}}
\end{lstlisting}
Here, input encodig is assumed to be UTF-8.

\subsection{CJK-\LaTeX}

CJK-\LaTeX\ users are required to have Subfont Definition Files to be installed.
They are available as part of the \package{ttfutils} package.

To use TrueType Ariphic fonts provided by the \package{arphic-ttf} package:
\begin{lstlisting}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{CJKutf8}
...Other packages loaded here...
\AtBeginDocument{%
  \special{pdf:tounicode UTF8-USC2}%
  \special{pdf:mapline bsmiu@Unicode@ unicode bsmi00lp.ttf}%
 }
\begin{document}
\begin{CJK}{UTF8}{bsmi}
...some Chinese text goes here...
\end{CJK}
\end{document}
\end{lstlisting}
Here, \code{pdf:mapline} special is used to setup fontmappings.

\section{Auxiliary Files}\label{SEC:auxfiles}

This section is mostly for supporting legacy encodings and legacy font format
such as PostScript Type1 font. \XeTeX\ users may skip this section.

\dvipdfmx\ has a capability to handle various input encodings from 7-bit
encodings to variable-width multi-byte encodings. It also has some sort of
Unicode support. Several auxiliary files which are not common to \TeX\ users
are needed to enable those features. This section shortly describes about them.

\subsection{PostScript CMap Resources}

PostScript CMap Resources\footnote{See, ``\href{http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/font/pdfs/5014.CIDFont\_Spec.pdf}{Adobe CMap and CIDFont Files Specification}''}
are required for supporting lagacy encodings such as Shift-JIS, EUC-JP, Big5,
and other East Asian encodings. \dvipdfmx\ internally identifies glyphs with
identifiers (CIDs\footnote{PostScript terminology ``Character IDentifier''.})
represented as an integer ranging from 0 to 65535 in the CID-based glyph access.
PostScript CMap Resources describes the mapping between sequences of input
character codes and CIDs. \dvipdfmx\ has an extensible support for multi-byte
encodings via PostScript CMap Resources.

CMap files for standard East Asian encodings, for use with Adobe's character
collections, are included in the \package{adobemapping} package.
The latest version of those CMap files maintained by Adobe can be found at
Adobe's GitHub Project page:\medskip

\url{http://github.com/adobe-type-tools/cmap-resources}
\medskip

Those files are mandatory for supporting p\TeX. up\TeX\ users may also
want to install them but they are not required.

\subsection{Subfont Definition Files}

CJK fonts usually contain several thousands of glyphs. For using such fonts
with (original) \TeX, which can only handle 8-bit encodings, it is necessary to
split fonts into several ``subfonts''. Subfont Definition File (SFD)
specify the way how those fonts are split into subfonts. \dvipdfmx\ uses SFD
files to convert subfonts back to a single font.

SFD files are not required for use with \TeX\ variants which can handle
multi-byte character encodings and large character sets such as p\TeX,
up\TeX,\XeTeX, and Omega.
H\LaTeX\ and CJK-\LaTeX\ users are required to have those files to be
installed. SFD files are available as a part of the \package{ttfutils} package
for \TeX\ Live users.

\subsection{The Adobe Glyph List and ToUnicode Mappings}

The Adobe Glyph List\footnote{See, ``\href{http://github.com/adobe-type-tools/agl-specification}{Adobe Glyph List Specification}''} (AGL)
describes correspondence between PostScript glyph names (e.g., \code{AE},
\code{Aacute},...) and Unicode character sequences representing them.
Some features described in the section ``Unicode Support'' requires AGL file.

\dvipdfmx\ looks for the file \code{glyphlist.txt} when conversion from
PostScript glyph names to Unicode sequences is necessary.
This conversion is done in various situations; when creating ToUnicode CMaps
for 8-bit encoding fonts, finding glyph descriptions from TrueType and OpenType
fonts when the font itself does not provide a mapping from PostScript glyph
names to glyph indices (version 2.0 ``post'' table), and when the encoding
\code{unicode} is specified for Type1 font.

AGL file is included in the \package{glyphlist} package. The latest version
can be found at Adobe's GitHub site:\medskip

\url{http://github.com/adobe-type-tools/agl-aglfn}
\medskip

ToUnicode Mappings are similar to AGL but they describe correspondence
between CID numbers (instead of glyph names) and Unicode values.
The content of those files are the same as CMap Resources.
They are required when using TrueType fonts emulated as CID-keyed fonts.
They should be found in the same directory as ordinary CMap files.

ToUnicode Mapping files are included in the \package{adobemapping} package.
Those files are not required for \XeTeX\ users.

\section{Overview of Extensions}

This section gives a quick overview of \dvipdfmx's extended capabilities.

\subsection{CJK Support}

There are many extensions made for supporting CJK languages. Features described
here is mainly for CJK languages but their use is actually not limited to it.
Those features are implemented in a generic way so that it can be beneficial to
users who are not involved in CJK languages.

\subsubsection{Legacy Multi-byte Encodings}

\dvipdfmx\ has an extensible support for encodings by means of
PostScript CMap Resources. Just like \code{enc} files are written for 8-bit
encodings, one can write their own CMap files to support custom encodings.
See, Adobe's technical notes for details on PostScript CMap Resources.

\subsubsection{Vertical Writing}

\dvipdfmx\ supports vertical writing extension used by p\TeX\ and up\TeX.
A DVI instruction to set writing mode is supported. OpenType Layout
GSUB Feature is supported for selecting vertical version of glyphs.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\jphoritext\hspace{24pt}\jpverttext%
\caption{An example of horizontal and vertical text;
left and right corner brackets are replaced with their vertical counterparts.}%
\label{FIG:verttext}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Unicode Support}

Unicode support here consists of two parts: Supporting Unicode as input
encodings and making output PDF files ``Unicode aware''.

\subsubsection{Unicode as Input Encoding}

\dvipdfmx\ recognizes an additional keyword \code{unicode} in fontmap files
to declare that Unicode values are used in input DVI files. Unicode support is
basically limited to the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) since there are no
support for code ranges that requires more than three bytes in TFM and extended
TFM formats.

\subsubsection{ToUnicode CMap Support}

In PDF,it is often the case that text is not encoded in Unicode.
However, modern applications usually want them represented in Unicode to make
it usable. ToUnicode CMap is a bridge between PDF text string encodings
and Unicode encodings, and they makes it possible to extract text in PDF as
Unicode encoded strings. It is important to make resulting PDF search-able and
copy-and-past-able. Dvipdfmx supports the auto-creation of ToUnicode CMaps.

It will not work properly for multiply encoded glyphs due to fundamental
limitations of Unicode conversion mechanism with ToUnicode CMaps.

\subsection{Other Extensions}

\dvipdfmx\ can generate encrypted PDF documents to protect its contents from
unauthorized access. It is limited to passorwd-based authentication, and
public-key based authentication is not supported. The 256-bit AES encryption is
also supported for PDF version 1.7 setting although it may not be supported
by PDF viewers.

There are various other improvements over \dvipdfm. The most notable one is
more improved PDF input and output support: The cross-reference stream and
object stream introduced in \lnum{PDF-1.5} are also supported.

\chapter{Graphics}

\section{Image Inclusion}\label{SEC:graphics}

The basics of incorporating images into output PDF is the same as in \dvipdfm.
\LaTeX\ users can simply use the \package{graphicx} package (possibly with the
driver option \code{dvipdfmx}) to do this. This section is \emph{not} for
providing a how-to guide to include images into output PDF files. Just for
supported graphics and image formats along with supported features.

Graphics support was mostly rewritten in \dvipdfmx.
Support for BMP and JPEG\lnum{2000} was added. An effort to preserve more
information originally found in included images, e.g., embedded ICC Profiles
and XMP Metadata, was made.

However, \dvipdfmx\ does not support various features common to graphics
manipulation programs such as resampling, color conversion, and selection of
compression filters. Thus, it is recommended to use other programs specialized
in image manipulation for preparation of images.

\subsection{Supported Graphics File Formats}

Supported formats are, PNG, JPEG, \lnum{JPEG2000}, BMP, PDF, and \MP\ generated
EPS. All other format images, such as SVG and PostScript, must be converted to
other format supported by \dvipdfmx\ before inclusion.
The \option{-D} option, as in \dvipdfm, can be used for filtering images.

\subsubsection{PNG and JPEG}

PNG and JPEG are supported as in \dvipdfm.

PNG support includes most of important features of PNG format such as color
palette, transparency, 16bit bit-depth color, embedded ICC Profiles, and
calibrated colors specified by \code{gAMA} and \code{cHRM} chunks.
XMP Metadata is also supported.

Predictor filter may be applied before compression, which results in better
compression for larger images. \dvipdfmx\ supports TIFF Predictor 2 and PNG
optimum filters. However, there are yet no way to specify which predictor
function is to be used.
Using predictor filters usually gives better compression for images
but there is a case that compression speed becomes significantly slower.
Try \option{-C 0x20} command line option to disable predictor filters and to
check if slowness is due to filtering.
For PNG optimum filter, the ``minimum sum of absolute differences''
heuristic approach is employed for finding the most optimal filter to be used.
See, discussion on\medskip

\url{http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG-Encoders.html\#E.Filter-selection}
\medskip

JPEG is relatively well supported. \dvipdfmx\ supports embedded ICC Profiles
and CMYK color. Embedded XMP metadata is also supported.
JFIF or Exif data is used to determin image's physical size.

\subsubsection{PDF and ``MPS''}

PDF inclusion is supported as in \dvipdfm, with various important enhancement
over \dvipdfm\ for robust inclusion. \dvipdfmx\ can handle cross-reference
streams and object streams introduced in \lnum{PDF-1.5}.
\dvipdfmx\ also supports inclusion of PDF pages other than the first page.
However, tagged PDF may cause problems and annotations are not kept.

The \code{pdf:image} special supports additional keys, ``\code{page}'' and
``\code{pagebox}''. The \code{page} key takes an integer value representing
the page number of PDF page to be included, and the \code{pagebox} takes one
of the keywords \code{mediabox}, \code{cropbox}, \code{artbox}, \code{bleedbox},
or \code{trimbox} for selecting page's boundary box to be used. For examples,
\begin{lstlisting}
\special{pdf:image pagebox artbox page 3 (foo.pdf)}
\end{lstlisting}
includes 3rd page of `foo.pdf' with boundary box set to \code{ArtBox}.


For \MP\ generated EPS files, multi-byte encoding support is added.
\dvipdfmx\ also supports ``\MP\ mode''. When \dvipdfmx\ is invoked with
\option{-M} option, it enters in \MP\ mode and processes a \MP\
generated EPS file as input.%
\footnote{\code{prologue} must be set to \code{2}.}

\subsubsection{Additional Supported Formats}

BMP is supported but limited to uncompressed or RLE-compressed raster
images. Extensions are not (won't be) supported.

\lnum{JPEG2000} is also supported. It is restricted to JP2 and JPX baseline
subset as required by PDF spec. It is not well supported and still in
an experimental stage. J2C format and transparency are not supported.


\subsection{Image Cache}

Caching of images generated via filtering command specified with \option{-D}
option is supported. It solves the problems that image inclusion becomes very
slow when external filtering program such as GhostScript is invoked each time
images are included.

Use \option{-I} option to enable this feature:
\begin{lstlisting}
-I 24
\end{lstlisting}
where the integer represents the life of cache files, 24 hours in this example.
Zero and negative values have a special meaning.
Value 0 for ``erase old cached images while leaving newly created one'',
-1 for ``erase all cached images'', and -2 for ``ignore image cache''.
Default value is set to -2.

\section{Graphics Drawing}

This section is not intended to be a guide for graphics drawing packages,
rather, to be a short introduction to PDF graphics drawing. Not specific
to \dvipdfmx. Uninterested people can simply skip this section.

\dvipdfmx\ does not offer a heigh level interface to draw graphics objects.
What can be done is to write raw PDF graphics drawing codes and to insert them
into output via the \code{special} command. Just to show an example,
the following code:
\begin{lstlisting}
\special{pdf:content
  1 0 0 1 0 0 cm
  0 100 m
  80 100 120 80 120 0 c
  S
}
\end{lstlisting}
draws a Bézier curve,
\begin{center}
\specialbox{120bp}{100bp}{pdf:content 1 0 0 1 0 0 cm 0 100 m 80 100 120 80 120 0 c S}
\end{center}
The \code{pdf:content} special is used here which is useful for inserting an
isolated graphics object.

This illustrates a typical example of PDF graphics drawings. It consists of
three parts; setting graphics state, constructing a path, and painting a path.
A graphics object is specified as a sequence of operators and thier operands
using \emph{postfix notation}. \keyword{Graphics state operators} comes first,
\code{cm} in this example sets the current transformation matrix (CTM). Then,
\keyword{path construction} operators follow; move to position $(0, 100)$,
append a Bézier curve from current point to $(120, 0)$ with control points
$(80, 100)$ and $(120, 80)$. Finally, a \keyword{path painting} operator
comes to draw constructed path. In this example the stroking operator \code{S}
is used.

\subsection{Guide to PDF Graphics Operators}

PDF employs essentially the same imaging model as PostScript.
So, it is easy to learn about PDF graphics drawing for people who are
well accustomed to PostScript.

\subsubsection{Graphics State Operators}

The \code{cm} operator modifies CTM by concatinating the specified matrix.
Operands given to this operators are six numbers each representing
transformation matrix elements:
Translation represented as $[1, 0, 0, 1, t_x, t_y]$,
scaling $[s_x, 0, 0, s_y, 0, 0]$,
rotation $[\cos\theta, \sin\theta, -\sin\theta, \cos\theta, 0, 0]$.

To uniformly scale the object, just use
\begin{lstlisting}
2.0 0 0 2.0 0 0 cm
\end{lstlisting}

The \code{w} operator sets the line width, e.g., `\code{2 w}' sets the line
width to 2.

An example of drawing a rotated rectangle:
\begin{lstlisting}
0.866 0.5 -0.5 0.866 30 2 cm 5 w 0 0 100 50 re S
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{center}
\specialbox{120bp}{96bp}{pdf:content 0.866 0.5 -0.5 0.866 30 2 cm 5 w 0 0 100 50 re S}%
\end{center}

To specify colors, use \code{RG}, \code{rg}, \code{K}, and \code{k} operators,
for RGB or CMYK color for stroking (upper-case) and filling (lower-case).
\begin{lstlisting}
0.866 0.5 -0.5 0.866 30 2 cm 5 w
1 0.4 0 0 K 1 0 0 0 k
0 0 100 50 re B
\end{lstlisting}
where the \code{B} operator fill and then stroke the path.
\begin{center}
\specialbox{120bp}{96bp}{pdf:content 0.866 0.5 -0.5 0.866 30 2 cm 5 w
1 0.4 0 0 K 1 0 0 0 k 0 0 100 50 re B}
\end{center}

A dash pattern can be specified with \code{d} operator.
Operands for this operator are the \keyword{dash array} and
the \keyword{dash phase}.
For examples, to specify a dash pattern with 6-on 4-off starting with phase 0:
\begin{lstlisting}
[6 4] 0 d 2 w 0 0 m 320 0 l S
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{center}
\specialbox{320bp}{30bp}{pdf:content
1 0 0 1 0 20 cm [6 4] 0 d 2 w 0 0 m 320 0 l S}
\end{center}

Other important operators are \code{q} and \code{Q}, which saves and restores
graphics state.

\subsubsection{Path Construction Operators}

Path construction normally start with a \code{m} operator which moves the
current point to a specified position and then a sequence of path construction
operators follows. The path currently under construction is
called the \keyword{current path}. A sequence of path construction operators
append segments of path to the current path and then move the
\keyword{current point} to the end point of appended path.
A typical sequence of path construction looks like:
\begin{lstlisting}
100 50 m
100 78 78 100 50 100 c
22 100 0 78 0 50 c
0 22 22 0 50 0 c
78 0 100 22 100 50 c
S
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{center}
\specialbox{120bp}{80bp}{pdf:content
100 50 m
100 78 78 100 50 100 c
22 100 0 78 0 50 c
0 22 22 0 50 0 c
78 0 100 22 100 50 c
S}
\end{center}
This example is an approximated circle drawn by four Bézier curves.

Table~\ref{TAB:operators} shows a list of path construction operators.
Those who are accustomed to the PostScript language should note that in PDF
the current path under construction is not part of the graphics state,
and hece is \emph{not} saved and restored along with the other graphics state
parameters.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{llp{6.9cm}}\hline
      Operands & Operator & Description \\ \hline\hline
      $x$ $y$ & \code{m} & Begin a new path by moving the current point specified by given operands.\\
      $x$ $y$ & \code{l} & Append a line segment from the current point to the point specified.\\
      $x_1$ $y_1$ $x_2$ $y_2$ $x_3$ $y_3$ & \code{c} & Append a Bézier curve to the current path. Two Control points and the end point given as operands.\\
      $x_2$ $y_2$ $x_3$ $y_3$ & \code{v} & Append a Bézier curve to the current path. Using the current point and first two operand as the Bézier control points.\\
      $x_1$ $y_1$ $x_3$ $y_3$ & \code{y} & Append a Bézier curve to the current path. The second
      control point coincides with the end point.\\
      --- & \code{h} & Close the current path by appending a straight line segment from the current point to the starting point of the path.\\
      $x$ $y$ \textit{width} \textit{height} & \code{re} & Append a rectangle. First two operands for the position of lower-left corner, third and forth operand representing width and
      height.\\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{List of path construction operators. All operators move the current point to the end point of appended path.}\label{TAB:operators}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Path Painting Operators}

There are basically four kind of path painting operators: \code{S}, \code{f},
\code{B}, and \code{n}. The first three for ``stroke'', ``fill'', and
``fill then stroke'' operators respectively, and the last one \code{n}
paints nothing but end the path object. For filling operators, there are
two kind of operators depending on how ``insideness'' of points are determined:
the \keyword{non-zero winding number rule} and the \keyword{even-odd rule}.
The even-odd rule operators are \code{f*} and \code{B*}.

The following example illustrates the difference:
\begin{lstlisting}
0 0 100 100 re 20 20 60 60 re f
1 0 0 1 120 0 cm
0 0 100 100 re 20 20 60 60 re f*
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{center}
\specialbox{220bp}{100bp}{pdf:content
0 0 100 100 re 20 20 60 60 re f
1 0 0 1 120 0 cm
0 0 100 100 re 20 20 60 60 re f*}
\end{center}



\chapter{Specials}

Several \code{special} commnads are added for more flexible PDF generation:
Creation of arbitrary stream object, controlling \dvipdfmx\ behavior, and some
specials which might be useful for graphics drawing packages.

\section{PDF Specials}\label{SEC:specials}

This section briefly describes additions to \dvipdfm's PDF (\code{pdf:})
specials.

\subsection{Additions to PDF Specials}

PDF object manipulation is a key feature of PDF specials.
The \code{pdf:fstream} special is added, which enables creation of PDF stream
object from an existing file. The syntax of this special is,
\begin{lstlisting}
pdf:fstream @identifier (filename) <<dictionary>>
\end{lstlisting}
where identifier and filename (specified as a PDF string object) are
mandatory and a dictionary object, following the filename, which is to be added
to the stream dictionary is optional.

For examples, to incorporate a XMP Metadata,
\begin{lstlisting}
\special{pdf:fstream @xmp (test.xmp) <<
    /Type /Metadata
    /Subtype /XML
>>}
\special{pdf:put @catalog << /Metadata @xmp >>}
\end{lstlisting}

Similary, \code{pdf:stream} special can be used to create a PDF stream
object from a PDF string instead of a file.
\begin{lstlisting}
pdf:stream @identifier (stream contents) <<dictionary>>
\end{lstlisting}

\code{pdf:mapline} and \code{pdf:mapfile} specials can be used to append a
fontmap entry or to load a fontmap file:
\begin{lstlisting}
pdf:mapline foo unicode bar
pdf:mapfile foo.map
\end{lstlisting}

\code{pdf:majorversion} and \code{pdf:minorversion} specials can be used to
specify major and minor version of output PDF.
\begin{lstlisting}
pdf:minorversion 3
\end{lstlisting}

To protect output PDF with encryption, use \code{pdf:encrypt} special
\begin{lstlisting}
pdf:encrypt userpw (foo) ownerpw (bar) length 128 perm 20
\end{lstlisting}
where user-password (\code{userpw}) and owner-password (\code{ownerpw}) must be
specified as PDF string objects. (which can be empty)
Numbers specifying key-length and permission flags here are decimal numbers.
See, section ``\hyperref[SEC:encryption]{Encryption Support}'' for a brief
description of permission flags.

Other notable extensions are \code{code}, \code{bcontent}, and
\code{econtent}. The \code{code} special can be used to insert raw PDF graphics
instructions into output page content stream. It is different from \dvipdfm's
\code{content} special in that it does not enclose contents with a \code{q}
and \code{Q} (save-restore of graphics state) pair.
A typical usage of this special is:
\begin{lstlisting}
\special{pdf:code q 1 Tr}
...some text goes here...
\special{pdf:code Q}
\end{lstlisting}
which changes text rendering mode to 1, as shown in Figure~\ref{FIG:trmode}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\mbox{\special{pdf:code q 1 w 1 Tr}%
{\fontsize{200pt}{200pt}\selectfont\textchi}%
\special{pdf:code Q}}%
\caption{A character drawn in the PDF text rendering mode 1.}%
\label{FIG:trmode}
\end{figure}

Be careful on using this special as it is very easy to generate
broken PDF files. The \code{bcontent} and \code{econtent} pair is somewhat
fragile and might be incompatible to other groups of special commands.
It may not always be guaranteed to work as `expected'.

\subsection{PDF Special Examples}

This section is intended to be a hint for advanced users.
Uninterested users can safely skip this section.

\subsubsection{Annotations}

In this section, some useful special commands for creating \keyword{annotations}
are explained. Note that viewer support is required for annotations to be
shown correctly.

First start with a very simple \keyword{Text Annotation} for attaching a
comment. This feature is supported by many PDF viewer applications.
\marginnote{\special{pdf:ann width 20bp height 20bp
  <<
     /Type     /Annot
     /Subtype  /Text
     /Name     /Comment
     /T        (Author of This Document)
     /Subj     (An Example of Text Annotations)
     /Contents (A Quick Brown Fox Jumped Over The Lazy Dog.)
  >>
}}

\begin{lstlisting}
\special{pdf:ann width 20bp height 20bp
  <<
     /Type     /Annot
     /Subtype  /Text
     /Name     /Comment
     /T        (Author of This Document)
     /Subj     (An Example of Text Annotations)
     /Contents (A Quick Brown Fox Jumped Over The Lazy Dog.)
  >>
}
\end{lstlisting}
\code{pdf:ann} special is used to create an annotation.

Likewise, \keyword{Rubber Stamp Annotation},
\begin{center}
\specialbox{150bp}{50bp}{pdf:ann width 150bp height 50bp
  <<
     /Type     /Annot
     /Subtype  /Stamp
     /Name     /Approved
  >>
}
\end{center}

\begin{lstlisting}
\special{pdf:ann width 150bp height 50bp
  <<
     /Type     /Annot
     /Subtype  /Stamp
     /Name     /Approved
  >>
}
\end{lstlisting}
Other keywords such as \code{Expired}, \code{Final}, \code{Draft}, and so on,
can be used in place of \code{Approved}.

One can create thier own stamps. For this purpose, specials
\code{pdf:bxobj} and \code{pdf:exobj} can be used for designing stamps.
Those specials ``capture'' all typset material enclosed by them into a
\keyword{Form XObject}, which is a reusable graphics object like included images.

For a simple example,
\begin{lstlisting}
\special{pdf:bxobj @MyStamp
             width 280pt height 0pt depth 40pt}
\addfontfeature{Scale=4,Color=FF9933}My Own Stamp
\special{pdf:exobj}
\end{lstlisting}
It captures typeset material ``My Own Stamp'' (this example uses \XeTeX\
specific command for changing font size and text color) into an object
\code{MyStamp} for later reuse.
Then, \code{AP} (\keyword{appearance dicrionary}) entry for controling
the appearance of annotations is used in the annotation dictionary:
\begin{lstlisting}
\special{pdf:ann width 280pt height 40pt
  <<
    /Type    /Annot
    /Subtype /Stamp
    /AP      << /N @MyStamp >>
  >>
}
\end{lstlisting}
Text stored in \code{@MyStamp} is used as ``Normal'' (\code{AP} entry \code{N})
appearance. (\code{R} for ``Rollover'' and \code{D} for `Down'' can be used.)

\parbox[t][0pt][c]{280pt}{%
\special{pdf:bxobj @MyStamp width 280pt height 0pt depth 40pt}%
\addfontfeature{Scale=4,Color=FF9933}My Own Stamp%
\special{pdf:exobj}%
}

The result is:
\begin{center}
\specialbox{280bp}{40bp}{pdf:ann width 280pt height 40pt
  <<
    /Type    /Annot
    /Subtype /Stamp
    /AP      << /N @MyStamp >>
  >>
}
\end{center}

With the following code, \dvipdfmx\ reads source file and creates a stream
object named \code{SourceFile}, and then creates file attachment annotation.
\marginnote{%
\special{pdf:fstream @SourceFile (\jobname.tex)}%
\special{pdf:ann width 10bp height 20bp
   <<
      /Type /Annot
      /Subtype /FileAttachment
      /FS <<
            /Type /Filespec
            /F    (\jobname.tex)
            /EF   << /F @SourceFile >>
          >>
      /Name     /PushPin
      /C        [0.8 0.2 0.2]
      /T        (The dvipdfmx project team)
      /Subj     (The Dvipdmfx User's Manual)
      /Contents (XeLaTeX source file of this manual.)
   >>
}}%
\begin{lstlisting}
\special{pdf:fstream @SourceFile (\jobname.tex)}%
\special{pdf:ann width 10bp height 20bp
   <<
      /Type /Annot
      /Subtype /FileAttachment
      /FS <<
            /Type /Filespec
            /F    (\jobname.tex)
            /EF   << /F @SourceFile >>
          >>
      /Name     /PushPin
      /C        [0.8 0.2 0.2]
      /T        (The dvipdfmx project team)
      /Subj     (The Dvipdfmx User's Manual)
      /Contents (XeLaTeX source file of the manual.)
   >>
}
\end{lstlisting}
A push-pin image must be shown in the margin if viewer supports this kind of
annotation.
PDF viewer applications are required to provide predefined icon appearances
at least for the following standard icons: \code{Graph}, \code{PushPin},
\code{PaperClip}, and \code{Tag}.

\subsubsection{Special Color Space}

This section gives various examples of using \keyword{Special color spaces}.
Examples in this section have a common structure. They consist of essentially
three parts. The first part is for definining color space itself.
PDF object creation commands like \code{pdf:obj} and \code{pdf:stream} are used
for this purpose. Next is for registering color space resources in the page's
\keyword{Resource Dicrionary}. It can be done via \code{pdf:put} command as,
\begin{lstlisting}
\special{pdf:put @resource <<
  /Category << ...key-value pairs... >>
>>}
\end{lstlisting}
where \code{@resource} represents current page's Resource Dictionary and
\code{Category} is for category of each resources such as \code{ColorSpace}.
Finally, graphics objects are placed, with or with a combination of
text and, PDF drawing operators inserted by \code{pdf:code} or
\code{pdf:contents} specials.

%%EXAMPLE: Separation Color Space
The first example is \keyword{Separation} color space:
\special{pdf:stream @TintTransform1
  ({0 exch dup 0.62 mul exch 0})
  <<  /FunctionType 4
      /Domain [0.0 1.0]
      /Range  [0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0]
  >>
}%
\special{pdf:stream @TintTransform2
  ({dup 0.78 mul exch dup 0.05 mul exch 0.71 mul 0})
  <<  /FunctionType 4
      /Domain [0.0 1.0]
      /Range  [0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0]
  >>
}%
\special{pdf:obj @Orange [
    /Separation /Orange /DeviceCMYK @TintTransform1
  ]
}%
\special{pdf:obj @Green [
    /Separation /Green /DeviceCMYK @TintTransform2
  ]
}%
\begin{center}
\mbox{%
\special{pdf:put @resources <<
    /ColorSpace << /CS01 @Orange /CS02 @Green >>
  >>
}%
\fontsize{40pt}{40pt}\selectfont
\special{pdf:code q /CS01 cs 1.0 scn}Orange\special{pdf:code Q} and
\special{pdf:code q /CS02 cs 1.0 scn}Green\special{pdf:code Q}
}
\end{center}
\begin{lstlisting}
\special{pdf:stream @TintTransform1
  ({0 exch dup 0.62 mul exch 0})
  <<  /FunctionType 4
      /Domain [ 0.0 1.0 ]
      /Range  [ 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 ]
  >>
}
\special{pdf:stream @TintTransform2
  ({dup 0.78 mul exch dup 0.05 mul exch 0.71 mul 0})
  <<  /FunctionType 4
      /Domain [ 0.0 1.0 ]
      /Range  [ 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 ]
  >>
}
\special{pdf:obj @Orange [
    /Separation /Orange /DeviceCMYK @TintTransform1
  ]
}
\special{pdf:obj @Green [
    /Separation /Green /DeviceCMYK @TintTransform2
  ]
}
\mbox{%
  \special{pdf:put @resources <<
      /ColorSpace << /CS01 @Orange /CS02 @Green >>
    >>
  }%
  \special{pdf:code q /CS01 cs 1.0 scn}
  Orange
  \special{pdf:code Q}
  and
  \special{pdf:code q /CS02 cs 1.0 scn}
  Green
  \special{pdf:code Q}
}
\end{lstlisting}

\code{TintTransform}'s defined here are functions for transforming
\keyword{tint} values into approximate colors in the
\keyword{alternate color space}
(\code{DeviceCMYK} in this example). PostScript calculator functions are used
for converting a single component value representing ``Orange'' or ``Green''
into four component CMYK values to approximate those colors. The ``Orange''
color $v$ is approximated as $(0, 0.62v, v, 0)$ in CMYK color space for
alternate display here.

The \code{cs} operator for selecting color space and the \code{scn} operator
for color values are used in \code{pdf:code} special.
Be sure that \code{pdf:put} command, which puts color space resources
into the current page's Resource Dictionary, goes into the same page as
subsequent drawing commands.

\dvipdfmx\ currently does not have an easy interface for using various color
space families such as CIE-Based color spaces (e.g., calibrated colors and
color space with an ICC profile) and Special color spaces (e.g., indexed,
separation, and shading and patterns).

%%EXAMPLE: Shading
Another example is \keyword{shading pattern}:
\begin{lstlisting}
\special{pdf:put @resources <<
  /Shading <<
    /SH01 <<
      /ShadingType 2
      /ColorSpace @Orange
      /Coords     [0 0 320 20]
      /Extend     [true true]
      /Function   << /FunctionType 2 /Domain [0 1] /N 1.0 >>
    >>
  >>
>>}
\special{pdf:content 0 0 320 20 re W n /SH01 sh}
\end{lstlisting}
where the ``Orange'' separation color space defined before is used again.
This example shows an axial shading (\code{ShadingType} 2) pattern.
\begin{center}
\makebox[320pt][l]{
  \special{pdf:put @resources <<
    /Shading <<
      /SH01 <<
        /ShadingType 2
        /ColorSpace @Orange
        /Coords     [0 0 320 20]
        /Extend     [true true]
        /Function   << /FunctionType 2 /Domain [0 1] /N 1.0 >>
      >>
    >>
  >>}
  \raisebox{-20pt}[0pt][20pt]{\special{pdf:content 0 0 320 20 re W n /SH01 sh}}
}
\end{center}

Type 2 (Exponential Interpolation) \keyword{Function} is used for mapping
coordinate values into color values. The above example, with the exponent
$N=1$, is just a simple linear-gradient.

The final examples is a \keyword{tiling pattern}.
\begin{lstlisting}
\special{pdf:stream @MyPattern

        /Type /Pattern
        /XStep 16
        /YStep 16

}
\end{lstlisting}

The above example defines a tiling pattern. The content stream containing
painting operators, \code{m} for ``move-to'', \code{c} for ``curve-to'',
\code{f} for ``fill'', and \code{S} for ``stroke'', defines the appearance of
the \keyword{pattern cell} for this tiling pattern. With the following code,
\begin{lstlisting}
\special{pdf:put @resources
    <<
        /ColorSpace << /CS01 [/Pattern /DeviceRGB] >>
        /Pattern << /PT01 @MyPattern >>

}
\special{pdf:content

}
\end{lstlisting}
A box filled with the tiling pattern defined above is drawn.
\special{pdf:stream @MyPattern

\subsubsection{Transparency}

%%EXAMPLE: Transparency
\XeTeX's transparency feature is currently lost in \xdvipdfmx, but the same
effect can be achieved by setting graphics state parameters with
\code{ExtGState} resources and \code{gs} operator. Here is a simple
transparency example:
\special{pdf:obj @gs01 <<
  /Type /ExtGState /CA 0.5 /ca 0.5 /AIS false
>>}%
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\mbox{%
  %\raisebox{120pt}{\parbox[t]{0.8\textwidth}{%
  %   \addfontfeature{Color=444444}\lipsum[1]}%
  %}%
  %\hspace{-0.8\textwidth}%
  \special{pdf:put @resources <<
    /ExtGState << /GS01 @gs01 >>
  >>}%
  \fontsize{220pt}{220pt}\selectfont
  \special{pdf:code q /GS01 gs 1.0 0.8 0.2 rg}%
  α%
  \special{pdf:code 0.4 0.8 0.4 rg}%
  \hspace{-0.3em}β%
  \hspace{-0.3em}\raisebox{0.5ex}{%
    \special{pdf:code 0.4 0.4 0.8 rg}%
    π%
  }%
  \special{pdf:code 0.6 0.2 0.8 rg}%
  \hspace{-0.2em}%
  γ%
  \special{pdf:code Q}%
}
\end{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
\special{pdf:obj @GS01 <<
  /Type /ExtGState /CA 0.5 /ca 0.5 /AIS false
>>}%
\mbox{%
  \special{pdf:put @resources <<
    /ExtGState << /GS01 @GS01 >>
  >>}%
  \special{pdf:code q /GS01 gs 1.0 0.8 0.2 rg}%
  α%
  \special{pdf:code 0.4 0.8 0.4 rg}%
  \hspace{-0.3em}β%
  \hspace{-0.3em}\raisebox{0.5ex}{%
    \special{pdf:code 0.4 0.4 0.8 rg}%
    π%
  }%
  \special{pdf:code 1.0 0.2 0.4 rg}%
  \hspace{-0.2em}%
  γ%
  \special{pdf:code Q}%
}
\end{lstlisting}
where values for \code{CA} and \code{ca} represent opacity of stroke and
fill color respectively. Again, \code{pdf:put} command must go into the same
page as subsequent grahics and text drawing operators.

\section{Dvipdfmx Extensions}

\newfeature{Addition in \TeX\ Live 2016}

\noindent{}A new special \code{dvipdfmx:config} was introduced in
\TeX Live 2016 which makes it possible to invoke a command line option.
Several single letter command line options except \option{D} are supported.
For examples,
\begin{lstlisting}
dvipdfmx:config C 0x10
\end{lstlisting}
sets the \dvipdfmx's compatibility flags. See, the section
``\hyperref[SEC:compatibility]{Incompatible Changes}'' for an explanation of
compatibility flags.

\section{PS Specials}

PS (PostScript) specials can be used to insert a raw PostScript code for drawing
graphics objects and transforming subsequent text and graphics.
Please note that support for PostScript operators in \dvipdfmx\ is very
limited. It is just enough for supporting \MP\ output. Only basic set of
operators for arithmetic and math, stack operation and manupilation,
graphics state, path construction and painting, glyph and font, are supported.
See, Table~\ref{TABLE:PS} for the list of
recognized PostScript operators.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{p{3cm}>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{8cm}}\hline
        Classification & Operators \\ \hline\hline
        Arithmetic \& Math & \code{add} \code{sub} \code{mul} \code{div} \code{neg} \code{truncate}\\
        Stack Operation & \code{clear} \code{pop} \code{exch}\\
        Graphis State & \code{gsave} \code{grestore}
          \code{setlinewidth} \code{setdash} \code{setlinecap} \code{setlinejoin} \code{setmiterlimit} \code{setgray} \code{setrgbcolor} \code{setcmykcolor} \\
        Coordinate System & \code{concat} \code{scale} \code{translate} \code{rotate} \code{idtransform} \code{dtransform}\\
        Path Construction & \code{currentpoint} \code{newpath} \code{closepath} \code{moveto} \code{rmoveto} \code{lineto} \code{rlineto} \code{curveto} \code{rcurveto} \code{arc} \code{arcn} \code{clip} \code{eoclip} \\
        Painting & \code{stroke} \code{fill} \\
        Glyph \& Font & \code{show} \code{findfont} \code{scalefont} \code{setfont} \code{currentfont} \code{stringwidth}\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{List of PostScript operators recognized by \dvipdfmx.}%
    \label{TABLE:PS}
\end{table}

It might be enough for the purpose of basic graphics drawings but as there are
no support for conditionals and controls it is not enough for complicated tasks,
espacially, the PSTricks package is not supported.

In \dvipdfmx, text handling is extended to support CJK text.
The following code draws Japanese text like shown in Figure~\ref{FIG:verttext}:
\begin{lstlisting}
\special{pdf:mapline uprml UniJIS-UTF8-H yumindb.ttf}
\special{ps: uprml findfont 16 scalefont setfont
  currentpoint moveto
  (...some Japanese text goes here...) show
}
\end{lstlisting}

\chapter{Fonts}

\section{Font Mapping}

Syntax of fontmap file is basically the same as \dvipdfm. There are few
extensions in \dvipdfmx. In addition to 8-bit \code{enc} files and
keyword \code{builtin} and \code{none}, \dvipdfmx\ accepts CMap name and
the keyword \code{unicode} in the encoding field.

This section is completely irrevant to \XeTeX\ users.

\subsection{Extended Syntax and Options}

Few options are available in \dvipdfmx\ in addition to the original dvipdfm's
one. All options and features that makes \dvipdfmx\ to use unembedded fonts
are deprecated, as by using them makes \dvipdfmx\ to create PDF files which can
be non-compliant to the ISO standards.

\subsubsection{SFD Specification}

For bundling up fonts split into multiple subfonts via SFD back into
a single font, dvipdfmx supports an extended sytax of the form
\begin{lstlisting}
tfm_name@SFD@  encoding  filename  options
\end{lstlisting}
A typical example looks like:
\begin{lstlisting}
gbsn@EUC@  GB-EUC-H  gbsn00lp
\end{lstlisting}
where TFMs \code{gbsn00}, \code{gbsn01}, \code{gbsn02}... are mapped into a
single font named \code{gbsn00lp} via the rule described in the SFD file
\code{EUC}.

\subsubsection{TrueType Collection Index}

TrueType Collection index number can be specified with \code{:n:}
in front of TrueType font name:
\begin{lstlisting}
min10  H  :1:mincho
\end{lstlisting}
In this example, the option \code{:1:} tells \dvipdfmx\ to select first
TrueType font from the TTC font \code{mincho.ttc}. Alternatively, the
\option{-i} option can be used in the option field to specify TTC index:
\begin{lstlisting}
min10  H  mincho  -i 1
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Non-embedding Switch}

\deprecated{Use of this option is deprecated.}
\noindent{}The character \option{!} in front of the font name can be used to
indicate that the font shall not be embedded. This feature greatly reduces the
size of the final PDF output, but the PDF file may not be viewed exactly in
other systems on which appropriate fonts are not installed.
\bigskip

\noindent{}NOTE: \dvipdfmx\ always converts input encodings to CIDs and then
uses Identity CMaps\footnote{Predefined CMaps \code{Identity-H} and
\code{Identity-V} for the identity mapping.}
in the output PDF. However, \lnum{ISO~32000-1:2008} describes as
\begin{quoting}
The Identity-H and Identity-V CMaps shall not be used with a non-embedded font.
Only standardized character sets may be used.
\end{quoting}
which had never appeared in Adobe's PDF References. This makes all PDF files
generated by \dvipdfmx\ with non-embedded CID-keyed fonts non-compliant to
the ISO standards.

\subsubsection{`Standard' CJK Fonts}

\deprecated{This feature is deprecated.}
\noindent{}Use of this feature shall be avoided for new documents. It is
described here since it might still be useful for some situations.

\dvipdfmx\ recognizes several `Standard' CJK fonts although there are no such
notion in PDF. In older days where there were not so many freely available CJK
fonts, it was sometimes useful to create PDF files without embedded fonts and
let PDF viewers or printers to use substitute fonts (tend to be higher quality)
installed in their systems. \dvipdfmx\ `knows' several fonts which might be
available in PostScript printers and PDF applications such as Acrobat Reader,
and uses them without actually having it.
See, Table~\ref{TABLE:StdCJKFont}, for the list of available `Standard' CJK
fonts.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lll}\hline
    Character Collection & Font Family & Description \\ \hline\hline
    Adobe-Japan1 & Ryumin-Light & PS printers \\
        & GothicBBB-Medium & \\

    Adobe-CNS1 & AdobeHeitiStd-Regular & Adobe Reader 7 \\
    Adobe-Japan1 & KozMinProVI-Regular & Adobe Reader 8\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{List of available `Standard' CJK font. Most of them are
    available as a part of Adobe Asian Font Packs for each versions of
    Adobe or Acrobat Reader.}\label{TABLE:StdCJKFont}
\end{table}

Only fixed-pitch glyphs (i.e., quarter, third, half, and full widths) are
supported for those fonts.

\subsubsection{Stylistic Variants}

\deprecated{Use of this option is deprecated.}
\noindent{}Keywords \code{,Bold}, \code{,Italic}, and \code{,BoldItalic} can be
used to create synthetic bold, italic, and bolditalic style variants from other
font using PDF viewer's (or OS's) function.
\begin{lstlisting}
jbtmo@UKS@  UniKSCms-UCS2-H  :0:!batang,Italic
\end{lstlisting}

Availability of this feature highly depends on the implementation of PDF
viewers. This feature is usually not supported for embedded fonts.
Notice that this option automatically disables font embedding thus
use of it is deprecated.

\subsection{Specifying Unicode Plane}

As there are no existing 3-bytes or 4-bytes TFM formats, the only way to use
Unicode characters other than the BMP is to map code range 0-65535 to different
planes via (e.g., to plane 1) \option{-p 1} fontmap option. This option is
available only when \code{unicode} is specified in the encoding field.

\subsection{OpentType Layout Feature}

OpenType Layout Feature fontmap options mentioned below are only meaningful
when \code{unicode} is specified in the encoding field.

With the \option{-w} option, writing mode can be specified.
\option{-w 1} denotes the font is for vertical writing. It automatically
enables an OpentType Layout Feature related to vertical writing, namely,
\code{vert} or \code{vrt2}, to choose proper glyphs for vertical text.

\newfeature{Addition in \TeX\ Live 2017.}

The \option{-l} (lower case el) option can be used to enable various
OpenType Layout GSUB Features. For examples, \option{-l jp04} enables
\code{jp04} feature to select \lnum{JIS2004} forms for Kanjis.
Features can be specified as a ``:'' separated list of OpenType Layout
Feature tags like \option{-l vkna:jp04}. Script and language may be
additionally specified as
\option{-l kana.JAN.ruby}.

An example can be
\begin{lstlisting}
uprml-v  unicode  SourceHanSerifJP-Light.otf  -w 1 -l jp90
\end{lstlisting}
which declares that font should be treated as for vertical writing and
use \lnum{JIS1990} form for Kanjis. (See, Figure~\ref{FIG:jp90} for an example)

\begin{figure}
\centering
\jpzerofourexamples\hspace{30pt}\jpninezeroexamples%
\caption{\lnum{JIS2004} vs. \lnum{JIS1990} form.}\label{FIG:jp90}
\end{figure}

This feature is limited to the single substitution, there are no way to select
a glyph from multiple candidates, such as in \code{aalt}, and specifying
general many-to-many glyph substitutions does not take effect.

\section{Other Improvements}

This section briefly describes other improvements made for \dvipdfmx.
There is an extension to glyph name handling in \code{enc} files for
seamless support of both PostScript Type1 and TrueType fonts.
PostScript Type1 font support is enhanced although this format might be
considered obsolete.

\subsection{Extended Glyph Name Syntax}

\dvipdfmx\ accepts the following syntax for glyph names in \code{enc} files:
\code{uni0130}, \code{zero.onum} and \code{T\_h.liga}.
Each represents a glyph accessed with Unicode value \code{U+0130},
oldstyle number for zero and ``Th'' ligature accessed via OpenType
Layout GSUB Feature \code{onum} and \code{liga} respectively.
Note that \dvipdfmx\ does not understand glyph names which directly
use glyph indices such as \code{index0102} or \code{gid2104}, since those
indices are private to each font.

When \dvipdfmx\ encounters a glyph name, e.g., \code{T\_h.liga}, it first looks
for OpenType \code{post} table if such glyph exists; if it exists, then
\dvipdfmx\ simply uses \code{post} talbe for mapping glyph name to glyph index;
if not, \dvipdfmx\ tries to convert \code{T\_h} to Unicode sequence (U+0054
U+0068 in this example) via the AGL mapping; then, OpenType cmap table is used
to further converting resulting Unicode sequence to a sequence of glyph indices;
finally, OpenType Layout Feature \code{liga} is applied to get desired glyph.

Glyph name of the form \code{a.swsh2} can be specified to denote 2nd swash
variant form of letter `a'.

\subsection{CFF Conversion}

\dvipdfmx\ supports on-the-fly PostScript Type1 to CFF (Type1C) conversion
which greatly reduces size of resulting PDF files when using Type1 fonts.
Conversion is essentially `lossless' and there should not be any quality loss.
However, due to differences in the ability of rasterizers, there might be
noticeable differences on the rendering result.

When using (older) Type1 fonts, \dvipdfmx\ may give the following warning:
\begin{lstlisting}
Obsolete four arguments of "endchar" will be used for Type1
"seac" operator.
\end{lstlisting}
This happens when there is an accented character made from composite glyphs.
This warning message is given as Adobe made the use of \code{endchar} operator
for composite glyphs deprecated.

However, as mentioned in
``Appendix C Compatibility and Deprecated Operators'' of Adobe Technical
Note \#5177,
``\href{http://wwwimages.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/font/pdfs/5177.Type2.pdf}{Type 2 Charstring Format}'',
PDF applications are supposed to support this operator. Hence, this warning
message can be ignored. Please note that deprecated use of \code{endchar}
operator for compositing glyphs is not allowed in ordinary OpenType fonts.
So, \dvipdfmx\ stops with an error if such font is encountered.

Use of Type1 font should be avoided as much as possible.
Please consider using OpenType version of font.

\section{Font Licensing and Embedding}

In OpenType format, information regarding how a font should be treated
when creating documents can be recorded.%
\footnote{See, `` \href{http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm}{OpenType Sepcification: OS/2 -- OS/2 and Windows Metrics Table}''.}
\dvipdfmx\ uses this information to decide whether embedding font is permitted.

This font embedding information is indicated by a flag called
\code{fsType}; each bit representing different restrictions on font
embedding.
If multiple flag bits are set in \code{fsType}, the least restrictive
license granted takes precedence in \dvipdfmx.
The \code{fsType} flag bits recognized by \dvipdfmx\ is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Installable embedding
    \item Editable embedding
    \item Embedding for Preview \& Print only
\end{itemize}
\dvipdfmx\ give the following warning message for fonts with `Preview \&
Print only' setting:
\begin{verbatim}
  This document contains 'Preview & Print' only licensed font
\end{verbatim}

For fonts with this type of licensing, font embedding is allowed solely for the
purpose of (on-screen) viewing and/or printing; further editing of the document
or extracting embedded font data for other purposes are not allowed.
One way to ensure this condition is to protect your document with a non-empty
password.

All other flags are treated as more restrictive license than any of
the above flags and treated as ``No embedding allowed''; e.g., if both
of the editable-embedding flag and unrecognized license flag is set,
the font is treated as editable-embedding allowed, however, if only
unrecognized flags are set, the font is not embedded.

Embedding flags are preserved in embedded font if the font is embedded
as a TrueType font or a CIDFontType2 CID-keyed font.
For all font embedded as a PostScript font (Type1C and CIDFontType0
CID-keyed font), they are not preserved.
Only \code{Copyright} and \code{Notice} in the FontInfo dictionary are
preserved in this case.

Some font vendors put different embedding restrictions for different
condition; e.g., font embedding might be not permitted for commercial
materials unless you acquire ``commercial license'' separately.
Please read EULA carefully before making decision on font usage.

See, for examples,
\href{http://www.adobe.com/products/type/font-licensing/font-embedding-permissions.html}{Adobe's site on font embedding permissions}
for fonts in the Adobe Type Library.
Microsoft also has a
\href{http://www.microsoft.com/typography/RedistributionFAQ.mspx}{FAQ page on Font Redistribution}.

For Japanese font in general, embedding permission tend to be somewhat
restrictive. Japanese users should read the statement regarding font
embedding from Japan Typography Association (in Japanese):\medskip

\url{http://www.typography.or.jp/act/morals/moral4.html}
\medskip

\dvipdfmx\ does not support full embedding. Only subset embedding is supported.

\chapter{Encryption}

\section{Encryption Support}\label{SEC:encryption}

\dvipdfmx\ offers basic PDF password security support including
256-bits AES encryption. Only ``Standard'' security handler is supported and
public-key security handlers are currently not supported.
Encryption is enabled by \option{-S} command line option.

When encrypting the document, up to two passwords can be specified --
an owner password and a user password. If a user attempts to open an encrypted
document that has a user password, PDF applications prompt for a password.
Correctly supplying either password enables the user to open the document to
display or to access to the contents.
Depending on which password (user or owner) was supplied, additional operations
allowed for an opened document is determined; full access for users who opened
the document with the correct owner password or additional operations
controlled by permission flags for users who opened the document with the
correct user password.

Access permision flags can be specified via the \option{-P} option. Each bits
of the (32-bit unsigned) integer number given to this option represents user
access permissions; e.g., bit position 3 for allowing ``print'', 4 for
``modify'', 5 for ``copy or extract'', and so on. See,
Table~\ref{TABLE:flags}.
\begin{table}[b]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lp{8.3cm}}\hline
        Bit Position & Meaning \\ \hline\hline
        3 & Print the document. \\
        4 & Modify the contents of the document. \\
        5 & Copy or extract text and graphics from the document. \\
        6 & Add or modify text annotations, fill in interactive form fields.
            Creation and modification of interactive form field is also
            allowed if bit 4 is set.\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Flag bits and their short explaination for the Revision 2
     Standard Security Handler.}\label{TABLE:flags}
\end{table}
For examples,
\begin{lstlisting}
dvipdfmx -S -P 0x34 foo.dvi
\end{lstlisting}
allows printing, copying and extraction of text, and adding and modifying
text annotation and filling in interactive form fields (but disallows
modification of the contents of the document).

The \option{-K} option can be used to specify the encryption key length.
The key length must be multiple of 8 in the range 40 to 128, or 256 (for PDF
version 1.7 plus Adobe Extension or forthcoming PDF version 2.0). Please note
that key length 256 requires Adobe's Extension to \lnum{PDF-1.7} and hence PDF
applications may not support it.

Password will be asked when encryption is enabled. It may not work well on
Windows platforms. Use the \code{pdf:encrypt} special instead of command line
options in this case.

The default values for \option{K} is 40 and for \option{-P} is \code{0x003C0}
(all bits from bit-position 3 to 6 set).

\chapter{Compatibility}

\section{Incompatible Changes}\label{SEC:compatibility}

There are various minor incompatible changes to \dvipdfm.

The \option{-C} command line option  may be used for compatibility to
\dvipdfm\ or older versions of \dvipdfmx. The \option{-C} option takes flags
meaning
\begin{itemize}
    \item bit position 2: Use semi-transparent filling for tpic shading
    command, instead of opaque gray color. (requires PDF 1.4)
    \item bit position 3: Treat all CID-keyed font as fixed-pitch font. This is
    only for compatibility.
    \item bit position 4: Do not replace duplicate fontmap entries.
    \dvipdfm\ behavior.
    \item bit position 5: Do not optimize PDF destinations. Use this if you
    want to refer from other files to destinations in the current file.
    \item bit position 6: Do not use predictor filter for Flate compression.
    \item bit position 7: Do not use object stream.
\end{itemize}

The remap option \option{-r} in fontmaps is no longer supported and is
silently ignored. The command line option \option{-e} to disable partial
(subset) font embedding is not supported.

\section{Important Changes}

Here is a list of important changes since the \TeX\ Live 2016 release:
\begin{itemize}
\item Changes to make PDF/A creation easier: Always write CIDSet and CharSet
for embedded fonts. Do not compress XMP metadata.
\item Merge from libdpx for p\TeX-ng by Clerk Ma.
\item Addition of \code{STHeiti-Regular-Acro} for CJK `Standard' fonts.
\item Command line option \option{-p} takes precedence over \code{papersize}
and \code{pagesize} specials.
\item Fixed serious bugs in supporting `\code{unicode}' encoding:
OpenType Layout Feature \code{vert} and \code{vrt2} was not enabled.
Support for format 2 CFF charsets was broken.
\item Added simplified version of OpenType Layout support: The `\option{-l}'
option in fontmaps.
\end{itemize}
The full \code{ChangeLog} entries can be viewed via the web interface of \TeX\
Live SVN repository:
\medskip

\url{http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/dvipdfm-x}
\medskip

There was an undocumented feature for supporting OpenType Layout but it was
